**Elephant Trunk Servo Controller**
This project is a Wi-Fi controlled 3-servos elephant trunk simulator using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a Tkinter GUI in Python. Users can control each servo's angle either via preset buttons (0°, 90°, 180°) 
or by entering a custom angle. The system also allows queuing multiple movements and executing them sequentially with optional delays.

**Features**
Control three servos wirelessly via ESP8266 over Wi-Fi.
Tkinter GUI with buttons and entry fields for preset and custom angles.
Queue multiple servo movements before execution.
Optional delay between movements for smoother simulation.
Real-time display of queued commands.

**Technologies Used**
Python with Tkinter for GUI
ESP8266 microcontroller with Wi-Fi
HTTP requests to communicate between PC and ESP8266
Servo motors for trunk simulation

**Usage**
Connect the ESP8266 to your Wi-Fi network.
Run the Python GUI on your PC.
Click preset buttons or enter custom angles for each servo.
View queued movements in the display box.
Click “Execute” to move servos in the queued order.
